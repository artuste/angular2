# Angular 2 demo + JWT

This is a demo of `Angular 2` (-alpha.21) which contains a basic application with `JWT` authentication.

It uses the boilerplate made by [Pawel Kozlowski](https://github.com/pkozlowski-opensource) called [ng2-play](https://github.com/pkozlowski-opensource/ng2-play).

This example is heavily inspired in the demo made by [Matias Gontovnikas](https://github.com/mgonto) and [PatrickJS](https://github.com/gdi2290) which is also an `Angular 2` demo with `JWT` [angular2-authentication-sample](https://github.com/auth0/angular2-authentication-sample).
